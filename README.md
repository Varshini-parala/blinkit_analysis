📦 Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard project

This project is a professional Excel-based dashboard for analyzing sales data from Blinkit, a quick-commerce platform. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, key performance indicators (KPIs), and insights derived from retail product and outlet data. Built using Excel tools like PivotTables, Slicers, and Charts, it helps users understand how products and outlet characteristics affect sales performance.

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains structured sales information from Blinkit retail outlets. Each entry represents an individual product record and includes data such as the item identifier, item type (like Fruits and Vegetables, Frozen Foods, Health and Hygiene), fat content (Regular or Low Fat), and product characteristics such as visibility on shelves, weight, and customer ratings. Additionally, the dataset includes detailed outlet-level information like outlet ID, type (Supermarket or Grocery Store), size, year of establishment, and city tier classification. This rich dataset enables a multi-dimensional analysis of product performance, customer preferences, and regional sales trends.

🔹 KPIs (Top Summary Metrics)
- ✅ **Total Sales** – Sum of all item-level sales
- ⭐ **Average Rating** – Average customer rating for all products
- 🏬 **Number of Outlets** – Count of unique outlet locations
- ⚖️ **Average Item Weight** – Mean weight of all items

📈 Visual Charts
- **Sales by Item Type** – Highlights which categories drive the most revenue
- **Sales by Outlet Type** – Shows contribution of each outlet type to total sales
- **Ratings Distribution** – Visual of how products are rated by customers
- **Item Fat Content Distribution** – Helps compare Regular vs Low Fat item sales

🎛️ Interactive Filters (Slicers)
- Filter dashboard visuals by:
  - Item Type
  - Outlet Type
  - Fat Content
  - Outlet Size
  - City Tier
These slicers let users explore specific areas of interest with one click.

🎨 Design Elements

The dashboard design is clean, visually consistent, and user-friendly:
- Built using a dedicated layout planner in the **"sheets design"** tab
- Colors are used for visual hierarchy (KPI cards, headers, charts)
- Easy navigation with consistent font and spacing
- Slicers and charts are well aligned and responsive
